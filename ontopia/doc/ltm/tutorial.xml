<abstract>
<para>
This technical report defines version 1.3 of the Linear Topic Map
Notation, also known as LTM.  It provides both an introduction and a
formal definition, the latter in the form of a complete EBNF
specification given in <xref linkend="sect-formal-spec"/>.
</para>

<para>
Please note that this document is not a formal specification from any
recognized standards body, but a Technical Report published by <ulink
url="http://www.ontopia.net">Ontopia</ulink>, a commercial company,
for the convenience of all interested parties. The specification may
be taken up by some standards body at some point, but nothing suggests
that this will happen soon.

<section>
<title>Linear topic map notation? What's that?</title>
<para>
The Linear Topic Map notation (LTM) is a simple textual format for
topic maps. Just like XTM, the XML interchange format, it represents
the constructs in the topic map standard as text, but unlike XTM it is
compact and simple. The notation can be written in any text editor and
processed by topic map software that supports it, or converted into
the XML format supported by such software.
</para>

<para>
The XML-based topic map interchange format is defined in such a way as
to make it easy to understand for humans and to develop software for,
and these purposes it fulfills very well.  However, this has the cost
of making it awkward to read and write for humans.  Humans were not
really intended to do this, of course, they were intended to use
specialized topic map editors, which would insulate their users from
the syntactical details of the interchange format.
</para>

<para>
Despite the existence of editors there is still a need for a simple
textual format that can be used to concisely and clearly express topic
map constructs in emails, discussions and similar contexts. Such a
format also makes it easy to quickly create and maintain small topic
maps for demonstration and personal purposes.
</para>

<para>
While you may find that this syntax provides you with a convenient and
easy way to maintain your topic maps, please note that the only
standardized form for interchangeable topic maps remains the XTM 1.0
syntax.
</para>

<para>
The notation has been developed by Ontopia.  Steve Pepper came up
with the original idea, based on the linear notation for conceptual
graphs. The notation has since been refined by Lars Marius Garshol,
with input from Geir Ove Grønmo, Steve Pepper, and Kal Ahmed. Useful
contributions from Murray Altheim, Akio Yamamoto, Robert Barta,
Michael Chapman, Thomas Flemming, Are D. Gulbrandsen, Kaj Hejer, Eirik
Jensen Opland, Tom-Anders N. Røst, and Ian Meikle are also gratefully
acknowledged. Lars Heuer pointed out a number of mistakes in and
suggested one improvement to version 1.3.
</para>

<para>
While the copyright to both this description and the format itself is
held by Ontopia, Ontopia reserves <emphasis>only</emphasis> the right
to be recognized as the originator of the notation.  Permission to use
it in any way for any purpose whatsoever is hereby granted in
perpetuity to all potential users.

<section>
<title>An introduction to the notation</title>

<section>
<title>Defining topics</title>
<para>
The basis of the notation is the ability to define topics, which is
done by writing the ID of the topic in square brackets. An example is
shown below.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm]
</screen>

<para>
This represents a topic map consisting of a single topic that has the
ID 'ltm', but no other characteristics.  If you want, you can provide
it with a base name and a sort name as well, as in the example below.
The sort name is optional.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm = "The linear topic map notation";
       "linear topic map notation, the"]
</screen>

<para>
You can even add a display name.  If you have a display name the sort
name is optional, but you need two semicolons to tell the parser that
the second name is a display name and not a sort name.  The example
below shows a topic with all three name types.
</para>

<screen>
[foo = "basename"; "sortname"; "dispname"]
</screen>

<para>
The topic can also be typed. The example below adds the type 'format'
to the <symbol>ltm</symbol> topic. Multiple type IDs can be listed
after the colon, separated by whitespace, if the topic has more than
just one type.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm : format = "The linear topic map notation";
                "linear topic map notation, the"]
</screen>

<para>
Note that even if no topic with the ID 'format' is defined anywhere in
the LTM file this reference will cause the topic to be created by the
LTM processor. The 'format' topic will have an ID, but no other
characteristics.  Note also that LTM is oblivious to whitespace.  You
can add as much whitespace as you want anywhere (except inside
strings) without having any effect on the resulting topic map.
</para>

<para>
LTM also supports providing subject indicators for topics, as shown
below. The URL of the subject indicator is quoted and preceded by an
'@' character. Any number of subject indicators can be given.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm : format = "The linear topic map notation";
                "linear topic map notation, the"
     @"http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"]
</screen>

<para>
For topics which represent information resources it is not necessary
to use a proxy resource (a subject indicator) to indicate the identity
of the subject; it can instead be referred to directly.  LTM supports
this, by using a '%' character followed by the quoted URL of the
resource. An example is shown below.
</para>

<screen>
[xmlspec : specification = "The XML 1.0 specification"
     %"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml"]
</screen>

<para>
The final construct supported by LTM for topics is scoping of names.
This can be done for the base name, sortname, dispname-trinity as a
whole, by appending a topic ID preceded by a slash after the name, as
shown below. Multiple topic IDs are allowed, separated by whitespace.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm : format = "Den lineære emnekart-notasjonen";
                "lineære emnekart-notasjonen, den"
                / norwegian 
     @"http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"]
</screen>

<para>
Note that if this example and the previous <symbol>[ltm]</symbol>
example were to appear in the same LTM file it would cause a single
topic to be created with the union of the characteristics of these two
definitions. That means that the topic would have the 'ltm' ID, the
format type, the two different name sets and the given subject
indicator.
</para>

<para>
Note also that there are no requirements on the order in which
constructs appear in LTM files.  A topic type can be used before it is
defined, for example.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Defining associations</title>

<para>
The LTM notation also supports defining associations. In the example
below the LTM topic defined above is associated with a topic with the
ID 'topic maps' by an association that has the
<symbol>format-for</symbol> type. ('format-for' is of course the ID of
the topic that types that association.)
</para>

<screen>
format-for(ltm, topic-maps)
</screen>

<para>
The meaning of this example is that LTM is a serialization format for
topic maps.  This should perhaps be made clearer by adding association
role types. The example below does this.
</para>

<screen>
format-for(ltm : format, topic-maps : standard)
</screen>

<para>
Note that if the association role type is omitted the role type will
default to the type of the topic (provided it has one). If the topic
has more than one type, one of these will be selected at random. The
rationale for this was that it is a useful shorthand for a commonly
occurring construction; we urge caution in the use of this construct,
however, as it can cause difficulties when topics have multiple types
or when their types change.
</para>

<para>
As a shorthand it is allowed to specify a topic in the role player
position, instead of just referencing it. All the constructs used when
defining topics can be used here, which means that it is possible to
define topics with their characteristics in the associations they
participate in without defining them anywhere else. The example could
therefore also have been written as follows.
</para>

<screen>
format-for(ltm, [topic-maps : standard = "Topic maps"])
</screen>

<para>
Associations can also be scoped, as with base names, by appending
a slash followed by the IDs of the scoping topics, separated by
whitespace. The example below illustrates this.
</para>

<screen>
[lmg : person = "Lars Marius Garshol"]

format-for(ltm : format, topic-maps : standard) / lmg
</screen>
</section>

<section>
<title>Defining occurrences</title>

<para>
LTM also supports defining occurrences.  This is done using the
notation shown below, where the occurrence information is given in
curly braces.  Three pieces of information, all of which are required,
appear inside the braces, separated by commas.  The first is the ID
of the topic which has the occurrence, the second is the ID of the
occurrence role type and the third is the locator of the occurrence in
double quotes.
</para>

<screen>
{ltm, specification, "http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"}
</screen>

<para>
You can also specify the resource data of an occurrence inline in the
LTM file, as shown below.
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[{ltm, description, [[A simple text-based format for topic maps.]]}]]>
</screen>

<para>
Occurrences are scoped in the same way as associations:
</para>

<screen>
{ltm, specification, "http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"} / english
</screen>
</section>

<section>
<title>A complete example</title>

<para>
Below is given a more complete example of an LTM topic map.  Note that
text appearing between '/*' and '*/' is comments.
</para>

<screen>
/* topic types */

[format       = "Format"]
[standard     = "Standard"]
[organization = "Organization"]

/* association types */

[format-for = "Format for"]
[defined-by = "Defined by"]

/* occurrence types */

[specification = "Specification"]
[homepage      = "Home page"]

/* topics, associations and occurrences */

[topic-maps : standard  = "Topic maps"
                        = "ISO/IEC 13250 Topic Maps" / fullname]

                "linear topic map notation, the"
     @"http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/ltm-tech-report.html"]
{ltm, specification, "http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/ltm-tech-report.html"}

{ontopia, homepage, "http://www.ontopia.net"}

[topicmaps.org  : organization = "TopicMaps.Org"]
{topicmaps.org, homepage, "http://www.topicmaps.org"}
</screen>
</section>


<!-- VARIANT NAMES -->
<section>
<title>Variant names</title>

<para>
Variant names are used to represent names that are alternative forms
of a base name. An example of this might be:
</para>

<screen>
[xml = "Extensible Markup Language"
         ("XML" / acronym)
         ("Extended Markup Language" / erroneous)]
</screen>

<para>
The canonical name for XML is "Extensible Markup Language", but there
are two related forms of it: "XML", which is the acronym, and
"Extended Markup Language", which is an often found (but wrong) form
of it. The example above represents these as variants of the base
name. Note that all variants must have a scope.
</para>

<para>
Note that sort name, display name, and base name scope must come
before the variants, as shown below.
</para>

<screen>
[xml = "Extensible Markup Language"; "extensible markup language" / english
         ("XML" / acronym)
         ("Extended Markup Language" / erroneous)]
</screen>
</section>


<!-- REIFICATION -->
<section id="sect-reification">
<title>Reification</title>

<para>
Reification may sound scary, but it's actually quite simple. If you
have a name, or association, or occurrence, or association role that
you want to say more about, how do you do it? For example, imagine
that you have an association like the one below, which states that I
work for Ontopia.
</para>

<screen>
employed-by(lmg : employee, ontopia : employer)
</screen>

<para>
What if you want to say when I started working for Ontopia? It's
possible to do this by turning the employment into a topic and using
two associations (one from me to the employment and another from the
employment to Ontopia), but if you don't want to do that you are
stuck, because topic maps don't let you put an occurrence on an
association.
</para>

<para>
This is where reification comes in: you create a topic that represents
the association (that is, the topic reifies the association). Then you
can assign an occurrence to the reifying topic, and all is well.
</para>

<para>
The way to do this in LTM is to add <symbol>~ topicid</symbol> after
the construct you want to reify. The ID is the ID of the reifying
topic, which you can use directly. So for the example above it would
be:
</para>

<screen>
employed-by(lmg : employee, ontopia : employer) ~ lmg-employment
{lmg-employment, start-month, [[2000-04]]}
</screen>

<para>
Similarly, to reify an occurrence, you could do this:
</para>

<screen>
{topicmaps.org, homepage, "http://www.topicmaps.org"} ~ tm.org-hp
last-modified-by(tm.org-hp : modified, lmg : modifier)
</screen>

<para>
This would say that I'm the last person to modify this occurrence.
For names, the syntax would be as shown below.
</para>

<screen>
[ltm : syntax = "LTM" / acronym ~ltm-name]
[ltm-name : name = "The name 'LTM'"]

invented-by(ltm-name : invention, steve-pepper : inventor)
</screen>

<para>
Special syntax is needed to reify the topic map; for that, see
<xref linkend="sect-topicmap-directive"/>.
</para>
</section>


<!-- DIRECTIVES -->
<section>
<title>Directives</title>

<para>
LTM has a concept of so-called "syntax directives", which are used not
to represent topic map constructs, but to provide information related
to processing. There are six different directives, each covered in a
separate section below.
</para>

<section id="sect-topicmap-directive">
<title>The <symbol>TOPICMAP</symbol> directive</title>

<para>
The <symbol>TOPICMAP</symbol> directive is used to make it possible to
reify the topic map itself. (How to reify other parts of the topic map
is shown in <xref linkend="sect-reification"/>.) This is useful, since
it makes it possible to attach metadata to the topic map using topic
map constructs. What the directive does is to create a topic that
reifies the topic map, and give it an ID.
</para>

<para>
Below is an example.
</para>

<screen>
#TOPICMAP ~topicmap

[topicmap = "An example topic map"]
</screen>

<para>
This creates a topic <symbol>topicmap</symbol>, which reifies the
topic map. This could then be used to add metadata about the topic
map, such as:
</para>

<screen>
#TOPICMAP ~topicmap

[topicmap = "An example topic map"]
{topicmap, publication-date, [[2005-01-12]]}
</screen>
</section>

<section>
<title>The <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol> directive</title>

<para>
The <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol> directive is used to merge external
topic maps into the LTM topic map. The external topic maps can be in
any syntax, but if this syntax is not LTM it must be declared what
syntax it is. An example is shown below.
</para>

<screen>
#MERGEMAP "geography.xtm" "xtm"
</screen>

<para>
This directive causes the topic map at the given URI to be loaded
according to the rules of the syntax it is written in and merged with
the current topic map once the loading is complete. This means that
topics defined in the loaded topic map will be merged with topics in
this topic map when they have the same subject indicator or subject
locator, but <emphasis>not</emphasis> because they have the same ID.
(For this behaviour, see <xref linkend="sect-include"/>.) Note that
the URI is allowed to use any URI scheme, although there is no
guarantee that an LTM processor will understand any URI schemes beyond
'file'.
</para>

<para>
LTM processors are required to recognize the syntaxes listed below,
but not necessarily to support them. XTM and LTM must be supported,
while the other syntaxes are optional. It is an error if the LTM
processor is asked to merge in a topic map in a syntax it does not
understand. Note that the syntax names are case-insensitive. If no
syntax is specified, the default is LTM.
</para>

</variablelist>

<para>
Directives declared in the merged-in file have no effect in the parent
file, except, of course, for <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol>s and
<symbol>INCLUDE</symbol>s.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-include">
<title>The <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> directive</title>

<para>
The <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> is very similar to
<symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol>, the difference being that with
<symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> the file merged in will use the same
namespace for IDs. This means that topics with the same IDs in the two
files will be merged (as will topics with the same subject indicators
or locators).
</para>

<para>
To use the <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> directive, simply write:
</para>

<screen>
#INCLUDE "other-file.ltm"
</screen>

<para>
Note that unlike <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol> the
<symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> directive only supports LTM files, and the
same limitations on URI schemes apply. Directives declared in the
included file have no effect in the parent file, except, of course,
for <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol>s and <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol>s.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The BASEURI directive</title>

<para>
This directive is used to change the base URI against which relative
URIs in the document are resolved. It works exactly like the
<symbol>xml:base</symbol> attribute in XML Base, or the
<symbol>BASE</symbol> element in HTML. Below is shown an example.
</para>

<screen>
#BASEURI "http://www.ontopia.net/"
</screen>

<para>
All URIs occurring <emphasis>after</emphasis> the directive will
resolve against the given URI, which must be absolute, rather than
against the URI of the LTM document itself. This applies to URIs in
<symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol>, <symbol>PREFIX</symbol>, and
<symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> directives, subject locators, subject
indicators, and the URIs of occurrences. (More formally, it applies to
all instances of the grammar symbol <symbol>uri</symbol>.) Note that
the <symbol>BASEURI</symbol> directive does not apply inside any files
included with <symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol> or <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol>.
</para>

<para>
Note that having more than one <symbol>BASEURI</symbol> directive in
the same file is an error. Note also that same-document references,
that is, URI references that consist only of a fragment identifier (of
the form <symbol>#foo</symbol>) are relative to the file URI, not to
the base URI set with this directive.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The <symbol>PREFIX</symbol> directive</title>

<para>
In some cases one wants to refer to a topic using its subject
indicator (or, less often, subject locator) for example because it's
defined in a different file that is loaded with
<symbol>MERGEMAP</symbol>. To do that using a topic ID you have to
create a new topic with an ID and give it the subject indicator, and
then refer to it with the ID. The <symbol>PREFIX</symbol> directive
makes it possible to refer to the topic directly using its subject
indicator.
</para>

<para>
Below is a simple example topic map that uses this capability.
</para>

<screen>
#MERGEMAP "core.xtm" "xtm" /* load superclass-subclass and other topics */
#PREFIX xtm @"http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/core.xtm#"

[sentient-being = "Sentient being"]
[human = "Human"]
[giraffe = "Giraffe"]

xtm:superclass-subclass(sentient-being : xtm:superclass, human : xtm:subclass)
xtm:superclass-subclass(sentient-being : xtm:superclass, giraffe : xtm:subclass)
</screen>

<para>
The <symbol>PREFIX</symbol> directive here declares that the
<symbol>xtm</symbol> prefix is used for topics whose subject
indicators (that's what the <symbol>@</symbol> means) begin with
<symbol>http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/core.xtm#</symbol>. The part
after the <symbol>xtm:</symbol> is added to get the full subject
indicator.
</para>

<para>
This can also be used for topic maps that define a lot of subject
indicators, so that you could write an LTM version of core.xtm like
this:
</para>

<screen>
#PREFIX xtm @"http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/core.xtm#"

[xtm:superclass-subclass = "Superclass/subclass"]
[xtm:superclass = "Superclass"]
[xtm:subclass = "Subclass"]
</screen>

<para>
These three topics would only have subject indicators and no IDs,
since when declaring the topics the subject indicator is used where
the topic ID would normally be.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The <symbol>VERSION</symbol> directive</title>

<para>
This directive is used to indicate what version of LTM the file is
written in. It has no particular effect in LTM 1.3, but if later LTM
versions are incompatible with version 1.3 it is possible that parsers
will use this information to process LTM 1.3 files with a different
parser.
</para>

<para>
To make it clear that your LTM file is using LTM 1.3, just write:
</para>

<screen>
#VERSION "1.3"
</screen>

<para>
Note that the <symbol>VERSION</symbol> directive has to appear first
of all the directives, if it is present. This restriction is there in
case new directives are introduced in later versions.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Escape syntax in strings</title>

<para>
Strings in LTM (that is, anything enclosed in double quotes) support
two different escape syntaxes. Firstly, if you need to include a
double quote in a string in LTM you can do it by writing it twice, as
in the example below.
</para>

<literallayout>
[doublequote : character = "The '""' character"]
</literallayout>

<para>
The name of this topic will be <symbol>The '"' character</symbol>.
</para>

<para>
There is also a general escape syntax for all Unicode characters:
<symbol>\u0000</symbol>. Four, five, or six hexadecimal digits can be
used to give the number of the Unicode character you want to write
(digits can be written in both upper- and lowercase).  Thus the
example above could also have been written as shown below.
</para>

<literallayout>
[doublequote : character = "The '\u0022' character"]
</literallayout>

<para>
The Unicode escape syntax is mostly useful for writing characters not
available on your keyboard. For example, if I wanted to write
'Katakana' in Japanese, I would do it as shown below.
</para>

<literallayout>
[katakana : syllabary = "Katakana"
                      = "\u30AB\u30BF\u30AB\u30CA" / native]
</literallayout>

<title>Formal syntax definition</title>

<para>
This section defines the LTM syntax using a formal extended BNF
grammar. Lexical tokens are given either as single-quoted strings
directly in the grammar, or as upper-case names of token types.  The
token types are defined separately further below.
</para>

<synopsis>
  topic-map  ::= encoding? version? directive* (topic | assoc | occur) *

  encoding   ::= '@' STRING

  directive  ::= topicmapid | mergemap | baseuri | include | prefix

</synopsis>

<para>
The lexical token types defined below use Perl-style regular
expressions for their definitions.  Note that while whitespace
(represented by the <symbol>WS</symbol> token type) is implicitly
allowed between any two tokens, it is explicitly required in the
'topic' and 'assoc-role' productions in the above grammar.  This is to
avoid problems caused by the fact that a colon is allowed in topic
IDs.
</para>

<synopsis>
  NAME       = [A-Za-z_][-A-Za-z_0-9.]*
      
  COMMENT    = /\*([^*]|\*[^/])*\*/
     
  STRING     = "[^"]*"

  DATA       = \[\[(([^\]]+\])*|\])\]

  WS         = [\r\n\t ]+
</synopsis>

<para>
The <symbol>NAME</symbol> token type is slightly modified compared to
the definition in the XML recommendation.  The colon is no longer
allowed as a name start character, since otherwise a single colon
could be both a name and a separator.
</para>

<para>
All tokens are case-sensitive.
</para>

<para>
Comments can occur anywhere where whitespace is allowed.
</para>

<section>
<title>Character encoding handling</title>

<para>
All LTM files are to be processed <emphasis>as if</emphasis> they were
composed of Unicode characters. Files may be in any encoding, but if
that encoding is not ISO 8859-1 it should be declared using the
<symbol>encoding</symbol> production. If the encoding declaration
appears in the file it must appear at the very beginning.  Support for
this construct is optional, but all processors must allow it to be
present and at least ignore it.
</para>

<para>
The encoding names used are those defined by IANA, which are the same
as those used by XML. The IANA character encoding identifier registry
can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets">http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Below is shown a simple example of an LTM file that uses the UTF-8
character encoding.
</para>

<screen>
@"utf-8"

[grove : person = "Geir Ove GrÃ¸nmo"]
</screen>

<para>
(The name is of course Geir Ove Grønmo, encoded in UTF-8, but viewed
as if it were ISO 8859-1.)
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Processing and references</title>

<para>
This section provides some clarifications for implementors in lieu of
a proper specification based on TMDM.
</para>

<section>
<title>Topic IDs and merging</title>


<para>
Any topic referred to by its ID in an LTM file, but never defined
anywhere by an explicit occurrence of the <symbol>topic</symbol>
production with that topic, is automatically generated by the LTM
processor. All occurrences of the same topic ID are considered to be
references to the same topic.
</para>

<para>
When an instance of the <symbol>topic</symbol> production is found,
and a topic with the same ID has already been found, the two topic
definitions are merged as follows:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The types of the resulting topic are considered to be the union
of the types found in each definition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The names of the resulting topic are considered to be the union
of the names found in each definition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The occurrences of the resulting topic are considered to be the union
of the occurrences found in each definition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The associations of the resulting topic are considered to be the
union of the associations found in each definition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The subject indicators of the resulting topic are considered to
be the union of the subject indicators found in each
definition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If more than one subject locator for the topic is found, the one
occurring last in the file is used.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
If two topic definitions are found which have different topic IDs, but
in which the same name occurs in the same scope, no specific behaviour
is guaranteed. Possible results are that the topics may be merged,
that they may remain distinct and that an error may be signalled.
Topics with equal subject locators or subject indicators but different
IDs are merged.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Sort and display names</title>

<para>
Note that although display names and sort names have a syntax that is
different from the general syntax for variant names they are still
considered variant names with the 'sort' and 'display' scopes from XTM
1.0.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The 'INCLUDE' directive</title>
  
<para>
The <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> directive requires special handling in
the parser. What happens (during all LTM processing, whether
<symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> is used or not) in terms of the Topic Map
Data Model (TMDM) is that topic IDs turn into source locators of the
form <symbol>uri-of-ltm-file#topic-id</symbol>. When a file is
included with <symbol>INCLUDE</symbol> all topics in the included file
get <emphasis>two</emphasis> source locators, one with the URI of the
included file, and one with the URI of the file that includes. (This
is what causes the merge by ID across the files.)
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Reification</title>

<para>
The <symbol>reify-id</symbol> production works as follows in TMDM
terms (where <symbol>id</symbol> is the id given in the
<symbol>reify-id</symbol> production):
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>If no topic with the <symbol>id</symbol> exists, one is
    created. If a topic exists, that is the topic used below.</para>
  </listitem>
 
  <listitem>
    <para>A source locator of the form
    <symbol>uri-of-file#--reified--id</symbol> (replace 'id' with the
    reification <symbol>id</symbol>) is added to the topic map
    construct being reified.</para>
  </listitem>
 
  <listitem>
    <para>A subject identifier of the form
    <symbol>uri-of-file#--reified--id</symbol> (replace 'id' with the
    reification <symbol>id</symbol>) is added to the reifying
    topic.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<literallayout>
#TOPICMAP ~tm
</literallayout>

<para>
In the example above, a topic with the id <symbol>tm</symbol> would be
created, and have the source locator <symbol>file.ltm#tm</symbol>
assigned to it. The topic map would have the source locator
<symbol>file.ltm#--reified--tm</symbol> assigned to it, and the same
URI would be assigned to the created topic as a subject identifier.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The 'PREFIX' directive</title>

<para>
The <symbol>PREFIX</symbol> directive causes qualified names like
<symbol>foo:bar</symbol> to be interpreted as references to the topic
with the expanded URI (the prefix URI + the part after the colon) as
its subject indicator (if the prefix declaration used '@') or locator
(if '%' was used). Note that qualified names can also be used in a
topic definition as below:
</para>

<screen>
[xtm:superclass-subclass = "Superclass/subclass"]
</screen>

<para>
This topic has no source locator (since it has no topic ID); instead
the qualified name gives it a subject indicator.
