<section>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
The Ontopia Schema Language provides a way to describe and constrain
the information in your topic maps, and this can be made use of in a
number of different ways. Some of the most important are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>To verify that the information in your topic maps is consistent
and meaningful. That is, that nobody has by mistake asserted that a
city was born in a composer, forgotten to say that Mozart was a
composer, or given an opera a birth date.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>To document the constraints which topic maps processed or
displayed by an application must abide by. Or, similarly, to document
the structure of your topic map.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>To help topic map editors and other applications provide a
better user interface, by making use of the information your schema
provides about your topic maps.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
This tutorial shows you how to write a schema for your topic maps and
how to validate the topic maps against the schema, but does not go
into making use of the schema in other ways.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The basics of the schema language</title>

<para>
A topic map schema in the Ontopia Schema Language consists of a set of
topic and association class definitions. These class definitions
constrain the structure of the instances of the classes, and so
control the form information may take in a topic map that uses the
schema.
</para>

<para>
This section shows you how the Ontopia Schema Language works by first
giving a general introduction to the concepts behind it, and then
walking you through the creation of a simple schema for the 'Free XML
Tools' topic map.
</para>

<section>
<title>How it works</title>

<para>
A schema in the Ontopia Schema Language consists of a set of topic and
association class definitions that state what the allowed structure of
instances of the classes are. The class definitions contain
constraints on the characteristics of instances of the classes, which
in turn may contain further constraints.
</para>

<para>
A topic map is validated against a schema by iterating over the
topics in the topic maps, validating each, then repeating the process
with the associations. For each topic or association the class it
belongs to is found, and the characteristics of the topic or
association are then validated against the constraints in the class.
Each characteristic is compared with the constraints until a
constraint matching the characteristic is found; the characteristic is
then validated against that constraint.
</para>

<para>
Generally, the type of the characteristic is used to match the
constraint, but for objects which have no type scope is used. A
special case is association roles seen from within topics, which are
matched by both role type and association type. This is because
different rules may apply to how a topic can play role A in
association B from how it may play role A in association C.
</para>

<para>
The table below shows what objects may be constrained in what
contexts, what is used to match them against their constraints, and
by what they may be constrained beyond what the rows in the table
show.
</para>

<para>
Note that a topic map schema in the Ontopia Schema Language does not
contain any topic definitions. Instead, it refers to typing and
scoping topics within the topic map to be validated by URI. This can
be done by referring directly to the <symbol>topic</symbol> element
within the topic map to be validated (using
<symbol>topicRef</symbol>), by referring to the subject identifier of
the topic (using <symbol>subjectIndicatorRef</symbol>), or by giving
the URI of the <symbol>topic</symbol> element relative to the document
URI of the topic map (using <symbol>internalTopicRef</symbol>).
</para>

<para>
What this means is that schemas in this schema language are not
independent of the topic maps they are used to validate. This is
slightly awkward, but we have not been able to think of any better
solution.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Introductory example</title>

<para>
In this section we'll make a schema for the 'Free XML Tools' topic
map, which you can find in the <filename>${basedir}/samples</filename>
directory. This topic map contains information about free and open
source XML tools, their authors, the standards they support, and/or
implement, and so on.  We'll create the schema step by step, using the
validation errors we get to improve the schema.
</para>

<para>
We start of with the simplest schema imaginable, one that simply says
that anything is allowed, which is what the schema below does.
</para>

<example>
<title>The unconstraining schema</title>
<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
<tm-schema match="loose">
</tm-schema>
]]>
</literallayout>

<para>
This schema has no classes, and uses loose matching. Loose matching
means that there are no constraints on topics and associations that
are not instances of one of the classes mentioned in the schema. Since
this schema has no classes it means that all topics and associations
will be accepted.
</para>
</example>

<para>
This, of course, is not very useful, so we'll add a class definition
for the 'standard' class of topics. Below is an empty class definition
for this topic type.
</para>

<example>
<title>Empty standard class</title>

<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
  <topic>
    <instanceOf>
      <internalTopicRef href="#TMTT_Standard"/>
    </instanceOf>

    <!-- characteristic constraints go here -->
  </topic>
]]>
</literallayout>

<para>
Above is shown an empty topic class definition. It looks just like a
topic in the XTM format, except for the reference to the topic that
defines the class. We use the <symbol>internalTopicRef</symbol>
element here, which contains a URI that is relative to the base
address of the topic map, rather than of the schema document. This is
useful because it means you can refer to the typing topic without
caring where the topic map document is located relative to the schema
document.
</para>

<para>
You can also use the <symbol>topicRef</symbol> element from XTM, but
this will then depend on where the topic map is located relative to
the schema. The <symbol>subjectIndicatorRef</symbol> element can also
be used, and is independent of where the topic map is located, but
requires the typing topic to have a subject identifier.
</para>
</example>

<para>
If we try validating the topic map with this schema (see <xref
linkend="sect-tools"/>) we get 374 errors, so clearly we need to
improve the schema. One thing we do know is that all standards have at
least one topic name in the unconstrained scope. We add the following
constraint to reflect that, causing the topic class definition to look
as shown below.
</para>

<example>
<title>Standard class with basename</title>
<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
  <topic>
    <instanceOf>
      <internalTopicRef href="#TMTT_Standard"/>
    </instanceOf>

    <baseName min="1" max="Inf">
      <scope></scope>
    </baseName>
  </topic>
]]>
</literallayout>

<para>
This example says that the topic must have one topic name or more in
the unconstrained scope (the <symbol>scope</symbol> element is empty).
The <symbol>min</symbol> attribute says we must have at a minimum 1
topic name matching this constraint, while the <symbol>max</symbol>
says that there is no upper limit on the number of topic names. Note
that if we'd left out these two attributes there would still have been
no upper limit, but standards would then be allowed to have no name in
the unconstrained scope.
</para>
</example>

<para>
Validating with this constraint we get only 290 errors. Many of these
are related to occurrences of the types 'specification', 'home page',
'link collection', and 'informational site'. We add four new
constraints to the topic class in order to get rid of those errors.
</para>

<example>
<title>Constraints for occurrences</title>
<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
    <occurrence external="yes">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMOR_Specification"/>
      </instanceOf>
    </occurrence>

    <occurrence external="yes">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMOR_Homepage"/>
      </instanceOf>
    </occurrence>

    <occurrence external="yes">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMOR_Site"/>
      </instanceOf>
    </occurrence>

    <occurrence external="yes">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMOR_Links"/>
      </instanceOf>
    </occurrence>
]]>
</literallayout>

<para>
These constraints allow topics of class 'standard' to have occurrences
of these four types. The <symbol>external</symbol> attribute is here
used to say that the occurrences must be external (that is, they can't
use <symbol>resourceData</symbol>). It is possible to constrain the
scope of occurrences as well, by using the <symbol>scope</symbol>
element inside the <symbol>occurrence</symbol> element, but we have no
use for that here, so we don't do it.
</para>
</example>

<para>
Validating with this improved schema gives us 247 errors, all of them
related to standards playing the role 'standard' in associations of
the type 'product implements standard' or 'product uses standard'. We
solve this by adding a constraint allowing these two uses.
</para>

<example>
<title>Constraint for association roles</title>

<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
    <playing>
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMTT_Standard"/>
      </instanceOf>
      <in>
        <instanceOf>
              <internalTopicRef href="#TMAT_StandardImplemented"/>
        </instanceOf>
        <instanceOf>
              <internalTopicRef href="#TMAT_ProductUse"/>
        </instanceOf>
      </in>
    </playing>
]]></literallayout>

<para>
This element says that topics of type 'standard' may play this role in
associations of one of the given types.
</para>
</example>

<para>
When we add this constraint to the schema it validates with no errors
at all. Note, however, that so far we only validate topics of one
type, and we do not validate associations at all. We validate the
roles the topics of type 'standard' play, but not the associations
themselves. In order to allow associations to be constrained as well
the schema language also supports association class definitions
</para>

<para>
As an example, we'll create an association class definition for the
'standard implemented' association. This is given below.
</para>

<example>
<title>Association class definition</title>

<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">
<![CDATA[
  <association>
    <instanceOf>
      <internalTopicRef href="#TMAT_Used"/>
    </instanceOf>

    <role min="1" max="1">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMAR_Used"/>
      </instanceOf>
      <player>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMTT_Product"/>
      </player>
    </role>

    <role min="1" max="1">
      <instanceOf>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMAR_Using"/>
      </instanceOf>
      <player>
          <internalTopicRef href="#TMTT_Standard"/>
      </player>
    </role>
  </association>
]]>
</literallayout>

<para>
What this class definition does is to say that associations of this
type must contain one role of type 'used, the player of which role
must be a product, and one role of type 'using, and that the player of
this role must also be of type 'product'. This means that the
association is constrained to always be a simple binary association
between two products, where one is used and the other is using.
</para>
</example>

<para>
At this stage, of course, we only validate one class of topics and one
class of associations. If we now change the schema to use strict
matching we get 1154 errors when validating.
</para>

<title>Tools for working with schemas</title>

<para>
Included in the distribution is a command-line tool for validating
topic maps against schemas. This tool can be run by giving the command
<command>java
net.ontopia.topicmaps.schema.impl.osl.cmdline.Validate</command>.
Doing so makes it show information on how to use it correctly. This
tool lets you easily and quickly try out schemas as you write them,
and also to easily verify your topic maps after you have created them.
</para>

<para>
Included in the distribution is also a validator plugin for the
Omnigator (see <citetitle>The Ontopia Schema Tools: Installation
guide</citetitle> for information on installing it). This validates
the current topic map against a schema, which it looks for in the
<filename>WEB-INF/schemas</filename> directory of the Omnigator web
application. It assumes that the schema document has the same file
name as the ID of the topic map being browsed, with the addition of
the extension ".osl" (e.g., "xmltools-tm.xtm.osl").

<title>TMCL</title>

<para>
ISO is currently working on a standard schema (or constraint) language
for topic maps, to be called ISO 19756 Topic Maps Constraint Language,
or TMCL. At the time of writing it seems that this language will be
very similar to OSL, but more powerful, and that the syntax will be
different. For more details, please consult 
<ulink url="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/">the TMCL home page</ulink>.
