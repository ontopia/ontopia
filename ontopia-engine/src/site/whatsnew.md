### Ontopia 5.3.0 release notes ###

This release is a bug fix and cleanup release and adds the new `NameIF` interface.

The following changes have been made:

*  Added `NameIF` interface to support operations that can return any name.
*  More generics were added to the Ontopia interfaces
*  The dependencies to patched artifacts hosted by the Ontopia repository (jing, trove and touchgraph)
   have been refactored to their respected pulic counterparts. This means the Ontopia repository is no
   longer present in the POM.
*  Removed the `PoolableSetFactoryIF`, `PoolableSetIF` and `SetPoolIF` interfaces and their
   implementing classes.
*  Improved the closing of `TopicMapSourceIF` objects when closing a `TopicMapRepositoryIF` object
   fixing possible memory leaks and clustering issues.
*  Added missing implementations for persisting reference title and base address changes in an RDBMS
   environment
*  Added functionality to LTM parser that allows reification based on a prefixed PSI
*  Added functionality to LTM parser that allows predefined PSI prefixes to be used when exporting a
   topic map
*  A long standing issue regarding difference of topic map loading in Navigator and Engine has been
   resolved. (issue 392)
*  Added fallback-value functionality to `tolog:id`, `tolog:oid` and `tolog:oid`
*  Improved tag pool handling in navigator tags, also added tests for this.
*  Fixed the export of topic maps within Ontoploy (issue 466)
*  Fixes missing classes in the Vizlet (issue 450)
*  Upgraded to SLF4J 1.7.5
*  Fixed issues in the TMRAP-webapp that were blocking the Axis SOAP service. Note that the presence of
   Crimson on the classpath will still stop TMRAP from working as a SOAP service.

   identifier](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/409)

### Ontopia 5.2.1 release notes ###

This release is a minor bug fix release, which includes the fixed vizigator and omnigator vizlet.

The following bugs have been fixed:

### Ontopia 5.2.0 release notes ###

This is the first release in the new Maven structure. It includes the modularization of Ontopia
along with bug fixes along with some new functionality.

The following changes have been made:

*  Ontopia is now divided into Maven modules based functionality. For developers working with Ontopia
   as a dependency this means that there is a more controlled way of including parts of Ontopia as a
   dependency. This change does not affect Ontopia distribution users.
*  The distribution has been updated to include Tomcat version 6.
*  The DB2TM functionality has been extended and improved.
*  Ontopoly had several outstanding bugs. Support for exporting TM/XML and schema without data was
   added.
*  Tolog now supports negative integer values and some basic numeric operations through the numbers
   module.
*  Ontopia now uses Lucene 2.9.4 (up from 2.2.0).

### Ontopia 5.1.3 release notes ###

This is a minor bugfix release that mostly fixes bugs, but also adds some fairly minor new
functionality.

The following changes have been made:

*  The `TopicMapFragmentWriterIF` interface has been added, providing a common interface to fragment
   exporters.
*  An RDF/XML fragment exporter has been added.
*  Major performance improvement in the retrieval of possible role players in Ontopoly.
*  The reordering of dynamic association predicates in tolog has been improved.
*  An Omnigator plugin for running DB2TM synchronization has been added.
*  Error reporting when DB2TM functions fail has been improved.
*  Several new utility methods have been added to the `KeyGenerator` and `MergeUtils` classes.

The following bugs have been fixed:

*  [Issue 316: No events for new role players](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/316)
*  [Issue 313: No events when associations are deleted](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/313)
*  [Issue 334: Incorrect encoding of characters in
   URIs](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/334)

*  [Issue 360: CTM parser doesn't accept fractional seconds and
   timezones](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/360)

### Ontopia 5.1.2 release notes ###

This is a minor bugfix release that fixes two issues in Ontopoly.

*  [Issue 320: Geotagging in Ontopoly: failed searches give no
   response](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/320)
*  [Issue 322: Ontopoly: list of "other topic maps" in random
   order](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/322)
*  [Issue 323: Ontopoly: association search popup
   broken](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/323)

### Ontopia 5.1.1 release notes ###

The main new feature in this release is the support for geotagging in Ontopoly. Briefly, if the
longitude and latitude occurrences are added to a topic type, all topics of that type will get a
button to open a geotagging window. In this window a position on a map can be chosen, and this
position will be written into the occurrences.

Further, pluggable support for authorization and authentication was added to Ontopoly, as described
[in the wiki](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/wiki/OntopolyHowTo).

Beyond that this release features mainly the following bug fixes:

*  [Issue 48: Ontopoly repository out of sync with the underlying topic map
   repository](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/48)
*  [Issue 105: Instance list in Ontopoly no longer displayed as tree when there is no
   tree](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/105)
*  [Issue 240: Problem with character " (quotation mark) in
   Ontopoly](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/240)
*  [Issue 259: XTM 2.1 export is now available in
   Ontopoly](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/259)
*  [Issue 275: LTM add-fragment support in TMRAP was
   broken](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/275)
*  [Issue 277: Fix to handling of equal parameters to
   rules](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/277)
*  [Issue 283: RDBMS schema no longer allows NULLs](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/283)
*  [Issue 287: tolog updates in Omnigator had no effect on
   RDBMS](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/287)
*  [Issue 292: Topic selection in hierarchy didn't work in
   Ontopoly](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/292)
*  [Issue 294: tolog did not optimize rule sets](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/294)
*  [Issue 302: Cost estimator in value-like predicate caused
   errors](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/302)
*  [Issue 305: Merging away sort and display topics in LTM caused
   errors](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/305)
*  [Issue 318: Save icon visible with RDBMS backend](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/318)

### Ontopia 5.1.0 release notes ###

This release introduces some major new functionality in Ontopia:

*  The automated classification is now available through public APIs and a command-line client. See the
   automatic classification developer's guide in the documentation index for more
   details.
*  The `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` statements have been added to the tolog query
   language, allowing it to also perform updates. See the section on updates in the tolog language
   tutorial for more information.
*  Support for XTM 2.1 has been added, together with some new classes to support it. Note that the
   `XTMVersion` class has been introduced to provide identifiers for the different
   versions.
*  Support for [JTM 1.0](http://www.cerny-online.com/jtm/1.0/) import and export has been added.
*  The CTM importer has now been updated to the final CTM specification.
*  Ontopoly can now be embedded in other applications using jQuery, as shown in the
   `examples/embedded-jquery.jsp` example in the Ontopoly distribution.
*  The query plugin in Omnigator now supports pluggable query language implementations, and also
   supports tolog updates.

In addition, some API changes have been made:

*  The core API now uses generics, making it much easier to use.
*  `TopicNameIF.getType()` never returns null any more, since [the default name
   type](http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/#d0e2429) now is always represented by a
   topic.
*  The `coalesce` predicate has been added to tolog (see [the predicate
   reference](http://www.ontopia.net/doc/5.1.0/doc/query/predicate-reference.html#p-coalesce)).
*  Some new methods have been added to the `QueryWrapper` class in the
   `net.ontopia.topicmaps.query.utils` package.
*  The `makeKey(ReifiableIF r)` method has been added to the `KeyGenerator` class in the
   `net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils` package.
*  `mergeInto` methods for all `TMObjectIF`s have been added to the `MergeUtils` class in the
   `net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils` package.
*  The `getFastSortNameStringifier` method has been added to the `TopicStringifiers` class in the
   `net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils` package.
*  The TMRAP `add-fragment` request now supports CTM input.

   getScopeDecider

a failing test. See [issue 163](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/163) for a description of
the problem and how to upgrade older databases.

### Ontopia 5.0.2 release notes ###

This is a bug fix release, specifically released in order to make the fix in [revision 486
(23e327d29029f653729374a1f3118fef8441191e in
github)](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/commit/23e327d29029f653729374a1f3118fef8441191e)
available to a customer who needed this fix. The fix solves performance problems with tolog
inference rules parsed into `DeclarationContextIF` objects.

A few other very minor fixes are also included in this version, which is otherwise very similar to
5.0.1.

### Ontopia 5.0.0 release notes ###

The biggest change with this release is a business change: the product is now open source, and the
name has changed from the Ontopia Knowledge Suite to just Ontopia. A consequence of this change is
that the license key restrictions are now completely gone from the product. You no longer need a
valid license key to run Ontopia.

The following changes have been made:

*  Ontopia now requires Java 1.5.
*  The old TMAPI 1.0 support has been removed, and support for TMAPI 2.0 added in its place.
*  The tolog query engine now has a new optimizer. See [the
   blog](http://ontopia.wordpress.com/2009/06/18/new-reordering-optimizer/) for more
   details.
*  The `net.ontopia.topicmaps.query.utils.TologSpy` class has been added, providing a jdbcspy-like
   query profiler for tolog queries.
*  The `net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.QNameRegistry` and `QNameLookup` classes have been added, providing
   convenient lookup of topics using qnames.
*  Ontopia now uses the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)](http://www.slf4j.org/), which makes it
   easy to switch logging tools, if desired.
*  The old net.ontopia.product classes have been removed, in favour of a single new class named
   `net.ontopia.Ontopia`.
*  The old net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext API is no longer supported and will be removed soon. The
   full-text search in tolog will continue to work.
*  The command-line tool `net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.Canonicalizer` has been updated to output
   ISO CXTM instead of Ontopia's old non-standard canonical format.

The following bugs have been fixed:

*  [Issue 2:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/2) template definitions crash CTM parser
*  [Issue 3:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/3) Name typing breaks on import into Ontopoly
*  [Issue 9:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/9) Nontopoly model in Omnigator broken
*  [Issue 17:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/17) Exception thrown in Ontopoly when clicking
   Add on "Add or remove topic type" when no topic type selected
*  [Issue 20:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/20) Exporting topic maps without schema broken
   in Ontopoly
*  [Issue 28:](https://github.com/ontopia/ontopia/issues/28) Merging lost item identifiers if they were
   the same as some subject identifier

   description occurrence
