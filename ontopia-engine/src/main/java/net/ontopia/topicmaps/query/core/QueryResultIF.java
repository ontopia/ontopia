 * query. That is, each row has a value for each column, and this is
 * the value of the variable in that particular match.</p>
 *
 * <p>The query result object always has a current row in the result
 * (except before the first call to <tt>next()</tt>), and the
 * <tt>getValue(int ix)</tt> method will return the value in column
 * <tt>ix</tt> of this row. To find the column number for a particular
 * variable, call <tt>getIndex("VAR")</tt>; alternatively, call
 * <tt>getValue("VAR")</tt> directly.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <tt>next()</tt> method is used to simultaneously step to the
 * next row <em>and</em> check if there is a next row.
