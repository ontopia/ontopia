 * PUBLIC: Computes the transitive closure of a relation characterized by

 * plays role R1 and T2 plays role R2 in an association A.
 *
 * A <i>transitive</i> relation is where "x is related to

 * z" Here, an association type, together with two roles
 * within that type of association, is taken as the relation 
 * which is transitive.</p>
 *
 * In topic map terms, if: T1 plays role R1 in association A1 and T2
 * plays role R2 in association A1 and: T2 plays role R1 in
 * association A2 and T3 plays role R2 in association A2 then: T1 and
 * T3 are also (transitively) related.</p>
