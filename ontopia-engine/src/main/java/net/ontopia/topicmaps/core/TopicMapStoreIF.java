/**
 * PUBLIC: A topic map store is used to represent the connection
 * between one topic map and a repository where the data instantiating
 * that topic map is held (in an implementation-specific form).  This
 * interface is used to retrieve a topic map from such a repository
 * and to save changes back to the repository. Implementations can be
 * made for different kinds of repositories.  The interface supports a
 * simple transaction model.<p>
 *
 * A topic map store is opened either explicitly through the open()
 * method or implicitly via the getTopicMap() method. If the store is
 * transactional, a new transaction is created when the store is
 * opened.<p>
 * 
 * To make persistent changes in the topic map, use the commit method.
 * To roll back any changes since the last commit (or open), call the
 * abort method.  (Note that this only works with transactional
 * stores).<p>
 *
 * Make sure that you close the store when you are done in order to
 * release resources held by the store. A closed store can be
 * reopened. Closing a transactional store aborts the current
 * transaction, so commit before you close.<p>
