/**
 * INTERNAL: Utility class that wraps an object and a stringifier for
 * use with the Object.toString() method. This class is useful when
 * code calls the default toString() method on objects.</p>
 *
 * Ideally is should be possible to call the
 * StringifierIF.toString(Object) methods directly, but sometimes this
 * is impossible especially when working with code that you yourself
 * doesn't control. Thus you can wrap your object and stringifier in
 * an object of this class to gain the power of stringifiers.</p>
 *
 * The Swing components generally use the toString methods on the
 * objects for display. This means that you're not able to use
 * stringifiers with these objects. It is where this class comes to he
 * rescue.</p>
