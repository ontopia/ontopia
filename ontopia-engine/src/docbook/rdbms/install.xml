    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The RDBMS Backend Connector adds relational database
    persistence support to the Ontopia Topic Maps Engine. The
    persistence is transparent and users of the topic map interfaces
    don't have to take any additional steps in order to persist topic
    maps. Applications that uses the RDBMS Backend Connector must
    properly demarcate transactions and follow the general rules in a
    transactional system. This includes managing the life-cycle of
    topic map stores and transactions.</para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>Before you can install and start using the RDBMS Backend
    Connector you must have an RDBMS server installed, and you must
    have created a database inside it. (The database can have any name
    since Ontopia finds the database name from the JDBC URL.) You also
    need a JDBC 2.0 driver, and to have set everything up so that you
    can connect to the database through the JDBC driver. If you want
    to use batch writing or connection pooling you will also have to
    install the JDBC 2.0 optional package. Once this is done, you are
    ready to start.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Requirements</title>
      
      <para>A JDBC 2.0 driver for your database must be available on
      your CLASSPATH. Your database vendor should be able to provide
      you with an appropriate JDBC driver.</para>

      <para>If you want to use connection pooling you need the JDBC
      2.0 Optional Package API (the javax.sql packages) on your
      CLASSPATH. This API can be downloaded from <ulink
      url="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/download.html">Sun
      Microsystems</ulink>.</para>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Unicode support</title>

      <para>Ontopia fully supports Unicode, but
      for the RDBMS Connector to support Unicode the database must
      support storing Unicode text. Most databases do not enable this
      by default, and require special options to be set when creating
      the database. This section documents these options for various
      databases. Note that you need only do this if you actually need
      to store Unicode characters in your database.</para>

      <para>If you don't do this, the tests in the test suite that
      verify Unicode support will fail. This will give failure reports
      like the ones shown below.
      </para>

<screen format="linespecific">
There were 4 failures:
1) testFile(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.xtm canonicalized wrongly"
2) testFile(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.iso canonicalized wrongly"

        <para>To create a database which stores text in UTF-8, give
        the <parameter>-E UNICODE</parameter> option to
        <command>createdb</command>, as in
        <command>createdb -E UNICODE topicmaps</command>. More
       information can be found on the

      <para>To modify a database to store text in UTF-8,
       execute the following commands. More information is available
       on <ulink

    <section>
      <title>Creating the database schema</title>

      <para>The next step is to create the topic map database schema
      in the database. This is done by executing the SQL scripts
      provided in one of the <filename>*.create.sql</filename> files,
      found in the <filename>$ONTOPIA_HOME/rdbms/setup</filename>
      directory. If there is no script for the database you are using,
      use the <filename>generic.create.sql</filename> script.</para>

      <para>There are also scripts for dropping the database
      schema in the same directory.</para>

      <para>These scripts create the tables with primary keys and
      indexes in the database. They also initialize the
      <symbol>TM_ADMIN_SEQUENCE</symbol> table by inserting a single
      row. The <symbol>TM_ADMIN_SEQUENCE</symbol> table contains the
      sequence counters used to generate object identities.</para>

      <para>In later versions we will provide a command-line tool
      which initializes the database for you automatically. In the
      meantime, if you run into problems when initializing the
      database, please send an email to <ulink
      url="mailto:support@ontopia.net">support@ontopia.net</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>The next step is to create a properties file that contains
      the information necessary to connect to the database.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Microsoft SQL Server 2005</title>

        <para>Only SQL Server 2005 or newer versions are
supported. Older versions may work, but there will be contention in
the database if used in a concurrent environment.</para>

        <para>In order to enable the snapshot isolation and row
versioning features (both needed by Ontopia) the following two
statements need to be executed in the database. Replace the
<symbol>topicmaps</symbol> name with the name of your database. Note
that this will not work with the <symbol>master</symbol> database as
the <symbol>read_committed_snapshot</symbol> is not supported in that
database. Use a custom database instead.</para>

<literallayout>
alter database topicmaps set allow_snapshot_isolation on;
alter database topicmaps set read_committed_snapshot on;
</literallayout>

        <para>More information about the database features can be found <ulink

    <section>
      <title>Setting up the properties file</title>

      <para>Before we can connect to the database we need to tell the
      backend how to connect to the database. This is done by writing
      a Java properties file that provides the necessary
      information. Below are listed the properties that need to be
      defined. You can put the properties file anywhere you like, but
      it is recommended to place it together with other configuration
      files. For Ontopia to find this file you have to point to it
      from the <filename>tm-sources.xml</filename> file. (See the
      Navigator Configuration guide for details, but by default this
      file is located in
      <filename>apache-tomcat/common/classes</filename>.)</para>

      <para>The default properties file for use in applications can be
      designated by setting the
      <symbol>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.PropertyFile</symbol>
      system property to the property filename. Note that the default
      can always be overridden through the APIs.</para>

      <para>A collection of sample database properties files can be
      found in the <symbol>$ONTOPIA_HOME/rdbms/config</symbol>
      directory.</para>

      <para>If multiple instances of the RDBMS Backend Connector are
      to access the same topic map(s) the clustering feature
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be enabled to prevent
      inconsistencies. As each instance holds an internal data cache
      any modifications to the data needs to be replicated across all
      nodes in the cluster. This must be done to prevent any of the
      nodes from holding stale data.
      </para>

      <warning>
        <para>Note that if your application uses the Web Editor
        framework then another clustering configuration needs to the
        set up. See the <citetitle><ulink

      <title>Caching</title>

      <para>The RDBMS Backend Connector retrieves all its data from
      the backing relational database. The communication with the
      database is relatively fast, but can introduce a big performance
      hit when the network traffic is high. In order to offer high
      performance Ontopia provides a number of client-caches that
      makes it possible to avoid repeated reads from the database.
      </para>

      <variablelist>
       <varlistentry>
         <term>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cache.shared</term>
         <listitem>
            <para>Type: boolean, Default: true</para>

            <para>Because the RDBMS Backend Connector supports
            concurrent transactions the database communication needs
            to be effective and non-redundant. Ontopia provides a
            cache implementation that transactions can share, so that
            redundant database access is avoided. This cache is
            enabled by default when using the Navigator and Web Editor
            Frameworks. Note that when using the Topic Maps Engine API
            one must access the topic map store through one of the
            topic map source implementations in the RDBMS Backend to
            make use of the shared cache. Warning: If one does not use
            the shared cache in a multi-user environment the
            performance hit can be very high.</para>

            <para>The only situation where you should consider
            disabling this cache is when you have one long-running
            transaction. In this case it is best to disable the shared
            cache because it adds an overhead and can, if the
            transaction is big, also cause the transaction to run out
            of memory. Without a shared cache there is no limit on the
            size of transactions.</para>

            <warning>
            <para>Do not disable the shared cache when there
            are concurrent transactions updating the
            same topic map as this would mean that the transactions
            might not see each other's committed changes.</para>

         <listitem>
            <para>Type: integer (# items in cache), Default: 300</para>

            <para>Each transaction maintains a mapping between the
            object ids of topic map objects and the topic map objects
            themselves. This data structure holds soft references to
            the topic map objects and the objects can therefore be
            garbage collected when there are no other hard references
            to them. This is a mechanism that lets the Java Virtual
            Machine get rid of objects when it needs to reclaim memory
            in order to not run out of memory. This datastructure is
            also extremely useful for the transaction itself because
            it uses it to avoid having to create object instances too
            often.</para>

            <para>This property tells Ontopia that it should hold hard
            references to the most recently used objects and for how
            many objects it should do so. Note that the property
            specifies the number of hard references per transaction,
            so when adjusting this number take into account how many
            concurrent transactions you might have and how much memory
            is available.</para>

            <para>This property is similiar to the previous one, but
            this one is used to define the size of the lru of the
            shared identity map. The shared identity map is shared
            amongst all read-only transactions. In general this one
            should be bigger than the previous one as there are
            usually a lot more read-only transactions in the system
            than read-write ones.</para>

      <title>JDBC connection pooling</title>

      <para>The RDBMS Backend Connector uses JDBC connections to
      access the relational database. Being able to reuse connections

      <title>Topic map store pooling</title>

      <para>Ontopia supports pooling of topic map stores in the same
      way as you can pool JDBC connections with the provided
      connection pool implementations. The topic map store pooling is
      currently only available via the topic map reference
      implementation in the RDBMS Backend Connector. When using the
      RDBMS Backend Connector with the Navigator and Web Editor
      frameworks the topic map store pooling is always enabled. Note
      that when using the Topic Maps Engine API one must access the
      topic map stores through one of the topic map source
      implementations in the RDBMS Backend to make use store
      pooling. These topic map source implementations always use store
      pooling.</para>

      <para>The main reason for using topic map store pooling is that
      it greatly improves performance in transactional
      environements. This is possible because topic map objects, topic
      map data, cached information and other state information can be
      reused across transaction boundaries.</para>

      <para>You can override the store pool defaults by setting the
      following properties:</para>

      <para>The RDBMS Backend Connector has its own tolog

      entire tolog query can be translated fully into a SQL query, but
      for some more complex tolog queries only parts or none of it can
      be translated. Sometimes it makes sense for a topic map
      application to not use the RDBMS tolog implementation. These

      <title>Native RDBMS full-text</title>

      <para>Instead of using the Lucene integration with the RDBMS
      Backend Connector one can take advantage of the native full-text
      support that the database may have. This support can range from
      simple LIKE operator queries to advanced full-text indexing
      support.</para>

      <para>In the
      <symbol>net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms</symbol> package
      there is a class called <symbol>RDBMSSearcher</symbol> that
      implements the <symbol>SearcherIF</symbol> interface. Pass your
      RDBMS <symbol>TopicMapIF</symbol> instance to the single
      constructor of this class and you have a searcher instance that
      let you search for topic name, variant name, and occurrences using
      the native pattern language.</para>

      <para>The actual queries that are issued and the syntax that are
      supported is usually database specific, but the default
      behaviour is to use the LIKE operator. This means that you can
      use the '%' symbol to specify wildcards in your queries. Most
      relational databases support the LIKE operator, and therefore
      the default should be ok for most databases. Note that the
      actual query will make use of the <symbol>lower</symbol> function
      to make it a case-insensitive query.</para>

      <para>In addition to the generic RDBMS full-text support Ontopia
      comes with support for several database-specific full-text
      implementations. They are all described below.</para>

      <para>Note that enabling native RDBMS full-text through the <symbol>net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</symbol> database property will also enable it for the
<symbol>value-like</symbol> tolog predicate.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Oracle Text</title>

      <para>Recent versions of Oracle comes with full-text
support included. The component is called Oracle Text. In older versions Oracle
Text was an optional component and had to be purchased and installed
separately.</para>

      <para>To enable use of  Oracle Text in Ontopia you will have to set the
      <symbol>net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</symbol>
      database property to
      <symbol>oracle_text</symbol>. You will also have to make sure that the
      columns <symbol>TM_TOPIC_NAME.content</symbol>,
      <symbol>TM_VARIANT_NAME.content</symbol>, and
      <symbol>TM_OCCURRENCE.content</symbol> are setup to be indexed
      by Oracle Text.</para>

      <para>Here are some sample statements to set this up for
      Oracle. Note that they require the Oracle Context Option, which
      for Oracle 8.x needs to be installed separately, but for Oracle
      9i and later it should be installed by default.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
create index TEXT_TOPIC_NAME on TM_TOPIC_NAME(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
create index TEXT_OCCURRENCE on TM_OCCURRENCE(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
create index TEXT_VARIANT_NAME on TM_VARIANT_NAME(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
]]></programlisting>

    <para>These indexes will be kept up to date on every commit. If
    you don't need to have them synced that often, consider changing
    the sync parameter.</para>

<!--
      <para>Be aware that Oracle Text does not keep the indexes up to
      date automatically. A possible solution to this is to make sure
      that the ctxsrv process is running and altering the indexes so
      that they are rebuilt automatically. Note that this is not
      neccessarily what you want.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
alter index TEXT_TOPIC_NAME rebuild online parameters('sync memory 45M'); 
alter index TEXT_OCCURRENCE rebuild online parameters('sync memory 45M');
alter index TEXT_VARIANT_NAME rebuild online parameters('sync memory 45M'); 
]]></programlisting>
-->

      <para>An error message will be issued by the Oracle RDBMS if one
      attempts to use the Oracle Text query when the columns have not been
      full-text indexed, so if this happens you will have to run the
      create index statements above or similar ones.</para>

      <para>Please consult your database documentation for more
      information on Oracle Text.</para>

      <!--para>You can customize the queries by modifying the
      'RDBMSSearcher.searchLike' query in your queries.xml file. Note
      that the queries.xml file that is currently shipped with the Ontopia
      is stored inside the <symbol>oks-enterprise.jar</symbol>
      file. You will need to unzip the file to modify the
      <symbol>queries.xml</symbol> file.</para-->

      <title>PostgreSQL full-text</title>

      <para>The full-text support in PostgreSQL is implemented through
a module called <ulink
url="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/">tsearch2</ulink>. This
module will usually have to be installed manually before it can be
used. This is typically done by logging in as the PostgreSQL
administrator user and running the
<filename>${PSQL_LIB}/contrib/tsearch2.sql</filename> script in the
database, e.g. using the <symbol>psql</symbol> command line
utility. If you later which to uninstall tsearch2 that can be done
with the <filename>${PSQL_LIB}/contrib/untsearch2.sql</filename>
script.</para>

    <para>The next step is to grant access to the tsearch2 tables to
the database user that is used by Ontopia. Replace
<symbol>myuser</symbol> with the name of your database user below.</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
grant all on pg_ts_cfg to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_cfgmap to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_dict to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_parser to myuser;
]]></programlisting>
  
      <para>tsearch2 will then have to be told which of its configurations that are to be used. Ontopia uses a configuration called <symbol>default</symbol>. The configurations are mapped to the server encoding. Issue the following statement to set the locale for the default configration.</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
update pg_ts_cfg set locale='en_US.UTF-8' where ts_name='default';
]]></programlisting>

      <para>If you don't know what the server encoding is then the following query will tell you:</para>
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
select setting from pg_settings where name='lc_ctype';
]]></programlisting>

      <para>The last step is to add a tsearch2 column and an index to
each of the three tables that are to be searched. To keep the index
up-to-date a set of triggers will also have to be added.</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
/* add columns */
alter table TM_TOPIC_NAME add column tsearch2 tsvector;
alter table TM_VARIANT_NAME add column tsearch2 tsvector;
alter table TM_OCCURRENCE add column tsearch2 tsvector;
/* create indexes */
create index tsearch2_index_tbn on TM_TOPIC_NAME using gist(tsearch2);
create index tsearch2_index_tvn on TM_VARIANT_NAME using gist(tsearch2);
create index tsearch2_index_to on TM_OCCURRENCE using gist(tsearch2);
/* populate indexed columns */
update TM_TOPIC_NAME set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content,''));
update TM_VARIANT_NAME set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content, ''));
update TM_OCCURRENCE set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content, ''));
/* add triggers */
create trigger tsearch2_update_tbn before update or insert on TM_TOPIC_NAME for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
create trigger tsearch2_update_tvn before update or insert on TM_VARIANT_NAME for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
create trigger tsearch2_update_to before update or insert on TM_OCCURRENCE for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
]]></programlisting>

      <para>To enable use of tsearch2 in Ontopia you will have to
set the
<symbol>net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</symbol>
database property to <symbol>postgresql</symbol> or <symbol>tsearch2</symbol>.</para>

      <title>Microsoft SQL Server full-text</title>

      <para>The full-text support in SQL Server is not enabled by default, so it will have to be enabled:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
EXEC sp_fulltext_database 'enable';
]]></programlisting>

      <para>Then a full-text catalog has to be created and one
full-text index added to each of the three tables that are be
indexed. The database server will keep the full-text indexes
automatically up to date as changes occur.</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[
create fulltext catalog okscatalog as default;
create fulltext index on TM_TOPIC_NAME(content) key index TM_TOPIC_NAME_pkey;
create fulltext index on TM_VARIANT_NAME(content) key index TM_VARIANT_NAME_pkey;
create fulltext index on TM_OCCURRENCE(content) key index TM_OCCURRENCE_pkey;
alter fulltext catalog okscatalog reorganize;
]]></programlisting>

      <para>Note that the <symbol>TM_TOPIC_NAME_pkey</symbol>,
<symbol>TM_VARIANT_NAME_pkey</symbol> and
<symbol>TM_OCCURRENCE_pkey</symbol> indexes referenced above are
primary key indexe names, but they may not actually have those names in
your database. You will have to look up the actual names of those
three indexes of the given three names don't work.</para>

      <para>To enable use of Microsoft SQL Server full-text in Ontopia you will have to
set the
<symbol>net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</symbol>
database property to <symbol>sqlserver</symbol>.</para>

      <title>Setting the CLASSPATH</title>

      <para>In order for the Java Virtual Machine to be able to load
      the RDBMS Backend Connector classes you need to add the
      ontopia.jar file to your <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> environment
      variable. See the <citetitle>Ontopia
      Installation and getting started</citetitle> document for more
