<abstract>
<para>
This is a guide to installing and getting started with using
Ontopia. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basics of
the host platform and of Java development.  See the <citetitle>What's
new in this release?</citetitle> document for information about this
release.
</para>
</abstract>


<!-- ===== REQUIREMENTS =================================================== -->
<section>
<title>Requirements</title>

<para>The most important requirement is that you must have the Java 2
Software Development Kit (SDK) version 1.5 or newer. There should be
no platform dependencies in the code, so the software should run on
all operating systems for which there is a supported JDK available.</para>

<para>
We have verified that the Navigator Framework runs in Tomcat versions
3.3, 4.1, 5.0, and 5.5, Oracle9i AS 9.0.3, WebLogic 7.0, and WebSphere
versions 4.0 and 5.0. It is quite likely that the framework also works
in other application servers than these, but this has not been
verified.
</para>

<para>
The RDBMS backend has been verified to work with Oracle 8.1.7, 9i, and
10g, PostgreSQL 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, MySQL 5.0, H2 Database 1.0.74 and
Microsoft SQL Server 2005.

<!-- =====  =============================================== -->
<section id="INSTALL_engine">
<title>Installation</title>

<para>
The first step in the installation is to uncompress the distribution
file, which you have presumably already done, since you are reading
this document. The topmost directory created by uncompressing the
distribution, the file called

  <filename>ontopia-X.X.X.zip</filename>

, will from now on be referred to as
<symbol>basedir</symbol>.</para>

<section>
<title>Setting the CLASSPATH</title>

<para>
If you want to use the Ontopia APIs to write Java software, or just
run the test suite, you will have to set up the
<envar>CLASSPATH</envar> environment variable. If you only want to run
the Navigator Framework this is not necessary, and you can skip this
section.
</para>

<para>
To set up the <envar>CLASSPATH</envar>, put the

  <filename>${basedir}/lib/ontopia-engine-x.y.x.jar</filename>

file in your <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> (Change x.y.z to your Ontopia 
version). If this does not work, or you want more detailed control 
over the jar files being used, please see
<xref linkend="sect-jar-details"/>.</para>

<note>
<para>The jar-file automatically includes the other required jar-files
for you via its manifest. In practice this means that you normally
need not put the other jar-files on your <envar>CLASSPATH</envar>
explicitly, but they all have to be located in the same directory for
this to work.</para>
</note>

<warning>
<para><emphasis>There may be some Java Virtual Machines out there that
do not support the new <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> jar-file manifest
header. If that is the case you'll have to add all the individual
jar-files to your <envar>CLASSPATH</envar>.</emphasis></para>
</warning>
</section>

<section>
<title>Verifying</title>

<para>
Now that you've set up your <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> environment
variable you can verify it by issuing the following command:
</para>

<screen>java net.ontopia.Ontopia</screen>

<para>It will run and produce the following output if it can find all
the classes required:
</para>

<screen>
Ontopia Topic Maps Engine [version]
Success: All required classes found.</screen>

<para>If it fails you will get output similar to the following:</para>

<screen>
Ontopia Topic Maps Engine [version]
Class 'org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator' not found. Please add log4j.jar to your CLASSPATH.</screen>

<para>The message is hopefully self-explanatory.</para>

<para>
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Testing</title>

<para>
Since Ontopia 5.2.0, testing is automatically done during creation of
the distribution. It is no longer needed to run the test suite yourself.

<!-- ===== GETTING STARTED =============================================== -->
<section>
<title>Getting started</title>

<para>Following is a short introduction to the end-user applications
that come with Ontopia.</para>

<para>For more information about developing with Ontopia you can find
a complete list of developer documentation <ulink
url="../index.html">here</ulink>.</para>

<section>
<title>The engine</title>

<para>
The engine consists of an SDK and some command-line utilities, and so
there is little that can be done with it apart from developing
applications on top of it.
</para>

<para>
To get started with application development we recommend that you
start by reading the <ulink url="engine/devguide.html">developer's
guide</ulink>. Once you have read that we recommend that you use the
javadocs in <filename>${basedir}/doc/api</filename> to learn the
details of the APIs.
</para>

<para>
You can find example topic maps in the
<filename>${basedir}/apache-tomcat/webapps/omnigator/WEB-INF/topicmaps</filename>
directory, which contains topic maps in the XTM 1.0, 2.0, CTM, and LTM
formats.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>The command-line utilities</title>

<para>
The engine comes with a collection of command-line utilities, which
can be used to perform various tasks on topic maps. The command-line
options of the utilities are not given here, but explanations can be
had by running the utilities with no arguments.
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.Canonicalizer</term>
<listitem>
<para>This application reads in a topic map and creates a canonical
representation of it using CXTM. CXTM has the property that logically
equivalent topic maps will always have byte-by-byte identical
canonical representations.</para>
<para>For more information on CXTM, see
<ulink url="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/cxtm/">the home page</ulink>.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.TopicMapConverter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Used to convert to and from different topic map syntaxes. It can
read XTM 1.0, ISO HyTM, and LTM 1.3 syntax, and can export to XTM 1.0,
HyTM, and LTM 1.3. It also supports importing from and exporting to
RDF.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.Merger</term>
<listitem>
<para>This application reads in two topic maps, merges them according
to XTM 1.0 rules, and outputs the result to a third file.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.StatisticsPrinter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Prints various kinds of statistics for topic maps to standard
output.</para>

<section>
<title>The Web Applications</title>

<para>
Ontopia comes with a number of useful web applications built with
Ontopia already set up and configured in a Tomcat installation. The
main applications are:

<para>
After starting the application server it will take a few seconds
before the server is initialized and ready to answer requests.
</para>

<para>If the application server fails to start correctly you may have
to set the <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> environment variable to point to
the directory where the Java Runtime Environment is installed. This
can be done either at the command-line before running the tomcat
startup script, or by editing the script to insert a line setting it.
See <xref linkend="sect-set-java-home"/> for details.

<!-- ===== FAQ ============================================================ -->
<section>
<title>Frequently asked questions</title>

<para>
This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about
Ontopia.
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Why do I get Not Found (404) when accessing the Omnigator?</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you get an error message saying <screen>Not Found
(404)</screen> followed by <screen>Original request:
/navigator/models/index.jsp</screen> and <screen>Not found request:
/navigator/views/template_no_frames.jsp</screen> when accessing the
Omnigator you have used a decompression tool that truncates file names
when unpacking files.</para>

<para>
We have confirmed that WinZip version 6.3 and earlier have this
problem, as does WinRar 2.90. WinAce may also have this problem. We
have confirmed that WinZip 8.0 and later do not have this problem.
</para>
<para>
The solution to the problem is simply to install a newer version
of the decompression tool and unpacking the distribution again.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<!--varlistentry>
<term>Why is the distribution incomplete?</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you find after unpacking the Omnigator on Solaris that
some of the files or directories are missing, you have probably
used a version of Solaris tar that is known to be buggy. Use GNU
tar instead.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry-->

<varlistentry>
<term>(Windows) When I start the server the window appears for a
moment, then disappears, so I can't even read the error
messages.</term>
<listitem>
<para>There are two things you can do. If you've created an icon to
start the server you can go into the properties of the icon, under the
"Program" tab, and unset the "Close on exit" option. This will make
the window stay around after the server exits, and give you time to
read any error messages that may appear. (If you're just starting it
by double-clicking <filename>startup.bat</filename>, then either make
an icon and set it up as described above, or try the option below.)
</para>

<para>
The other approach is to change the <filename>startup.bat</filename>
so that the line near that end that now reads:
</para>

<literallayout>call "%EXECUTABLE%" start %CMD_LINE_ARGS%</literallayout>

<para>
is changed to:
</para>

<literallayout>call "%EXECUTABLE%" run %CMD_LINE_ARGS%</literallayout>

<para>
This will keep Tomcat from opening a new window, so if you run
<filename>startup.bat</filename> from the command-line you should get
the error messages there.
</para>

<para>The server log is in
<filename>${basedir}/apache-tomcat/logs/localhost_log.&lt;date>.txt</filename>,
and it is likely to contain much detail information on errors. You can
try to decipher this file to find the cause of the problem, or if that
is difficult, you can just send the file to us at
<email>support@ontopia.net</email>, and we will try to help. Note that
if the file doesn't exist it means the server has been unable to start
and you should try one of the two options above to find out why.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<!--varlistentry>
<term>Why do I get "No topic maps in document"?</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you get this error whenever you try to load an XTM topic map
the problem is that the navigator is using some other XML parser than
Crimson. It uses JAXP to find the XML parser it uses, and this means
that if your Java (or tomcat) environment has another parser before
Crimson on the <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> that parser will be used
instead.</para>
<para>This problem can usually be fixed by making sure that tomcat is
run with an empty <envar>CLASSPATH</envar> and that no other tomcat
installations than the one in the navigator distribution are
present.</para>

<command>java</command> command when it is run. The command
<command>java -D&lt;prop>=&lt;value> ...</command> will set Java system
property <symbol>&lt;prop></symbol> to <symbol>&lt;value></symbol>.

Tomcat is usually started using the Tomcat startup scripts, and so one
needs to modify these in order to be able to pass command-line
arguments to the Java runtime. Below is explained how to do this on
Windows and Unix:
</para>

<varlistentry>
<term>Windows</term>
<listitem>
<para>Edit the <filename>${basedir}/apache-tomcat/bin/catalina.bat</filename>
file and insert the line below near the top of it.</para>
<para><command>set CATALINA_OPTS="-D&lt;prop>=&lt;value>"</command></para>
</listitem>

<title>Setting JAVA_HOME</title>

<para>
This section explains how to set the <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar>
environment variable on Windows.
</para>

<para>
If you start tomcat from the command-line you can give the command
<command>set JAVA_HOME=c:\path\to\java</command> before starting
the application server. Please replace
<filename>c:\path\to\java</filename> with the path to your Java
installation (for example <filename>c:\jdk1.5.0_13</filename>), make
sure that you have not accidentally put the <filename>bin</filename> sub
directory into the <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> environment variable.
</para>

<para>
On Windows NT, 2000, and XP you can also go into the control panel,
select 'System', then click the 'Advanced' tab, then click
'Environment variables'. This gives you a window where you can enter a
new environment variable named 'JAVA_HOME', the value of which must be
the directory where you installed Java.
</para>

<para>
On Windows 95/98/ME you can also edit the
<filename>AUTOEXEC.BAT</filename> file in the root directory of your
startup drive (usually <filename>C:</filename>) and insert a line like
the following into it: <command>set JAVA_HOME=c:\path\to\java</command>.
You will then need to reboot your computer before the change takes
effect.
